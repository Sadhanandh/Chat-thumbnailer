There are two different implementation->
requests-enabled -> which uses requests (urllib3) to fetch the webpage
urlib2-enabled -> which uses the same old urllib2 (shouldnt give you firewall troubles though.)

The Problem statement was to scan through the readable content of the page and according to relevance of location (The readability plugin which removes unnecessary data like comments,frames,header,footer etc) and fetch the image url if exists.

This is a simple quickfix implementation in python using flask.

Used libraries->

* Readability python lxml 
https://github.com/jcharum/lxml-readability

* lxml (I could have used regex to search img tag but anyway as readability uses lxml i did it too and moreover i always use the fast lxml over BSoup)

Run->
git clone https://github.com/Sadhanandh/Chat-thumbnailer.git
cd Chat-thumbnailer/urllib2-enabled
./flask_app.py

(If you dont have flask then install it in a virtualenv and get going.)
